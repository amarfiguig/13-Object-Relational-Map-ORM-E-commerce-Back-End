## 13-Object-Relational-Map-ORM-E-commerce-Back-End
  
The Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) E-commerce Back-End is a software system that allows for the creation of a functional e-commerce website by providing an interface between a database and a web application. It uses an ORM framework to map objects from a relational database to application code, simplifying the development process and allowing for more efficient database management.

   ## Description
  This project involved creating a functional back-end for an ORM E-commerce site using Express and Sequelize. The scope of the project was to build a robust system that can handle various CRUD operations and associations for different data types.
The objective of this project was to create a database backend for a retail company's inventory management system. This involved creating API routes and models for product categories, products, and tags.
My task was to write the API routes for a back-end e-commerce database to enable operations and association models for each data type.
